This tool does management of LetsEncrypt certificates.

* Run bundle (or bundle --deployment for production)
* Copy config.rb.example to config.rb and configure as needed
* Make bin/setup.rb to generate master keys, create directories, and accept the LetsEncrypt TOS
* Run with procodile
* Run bin/renew.rb from time to time

There are 3 endpoints:

* /~acmemanager/list - lists all currently valid certificates with their expiry date
* /~acmemanager/issue/example.com - issues a certificate for example.com
* /~acmemanager/purge/example.com - purges a certificate for example.com 

Requests must be authenticated by passing an API key in the X-API-KEY header.
